Problem Statement: Create a backend API that is a Question-Answering bot that leverages the capabilities of a large language model. 
This bot should be able to answer questions based on the content of a document. You will be using the Langchain framework to implement this functionality.

To complete this challenge, follow these steps using the Langchain framework:

Langchain Docs(https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) and build an API using FastAPI or Flask or Django.
Supported Input File Types: Your API should support two types for input over which questions can be answered:

JSON
PDF
Input Requirements: You need to provide two input files:

A file containing a list of questions (JSON).
A file containing the document over which the questions will be answered (PDF or JSON).
Output Format: The output should be a structured JSON blob that pairs each question with its corresponding answer.

Format example: {"question": "answer", "question": "answer", "question": "answer"}
